Suposing we do not have missing values nor outliers, we only need to discretize the values of the attributes that are non categorical. We will do this task dividing the values of each numerical column into 4 bins, corresponding to the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). For discretizing we used np.linspace. WE FINALLY DID BINS EQUALLY SIZED, SINCE IN MANY DATAFRAME THE DATA IS INCLINADA HACIA UN VALOR Y POR EJEMPLO SI HAY MUCHOS 0 AL DISCRETIZAR PUEDE SER QUE BINS = [0, 0, 0, 3, 67]. TRY: quartiles, except: bins linspace.

Note that there are some data of the same type and in some cases we may want to discretize and in others don't. For example: in cmc.data "age" and "weducation" are integer attributes, in this case "age" is a numerical attribute that wa may want to discretize but "weducation" is a categorical attribute which takes values from 1=low to 4=high, in this case we want to mantain the actual format of values 1, 2, 3 and 4. For this reason we examined the attributes of each dataset we wanted to classify and introduce 'by-hand' the numerical (integer) attributes that we want to discretize.

Note that, to check the redundancy of a rule we only check that it is redundant with the previous declared rules. We do not mind if it does not classify any unclassified instance since in the test data there may be an instance that could only be classified with that rule. Therefore we may have more rules than instances but these are never redundant rules.

Coverage: The percentage of records which satisfy the antecedent conditions of a particular rule.

The rules generated by the rule-based classifiers are generally not mutually exclusive, i.e. many rules can cover the same record. Note that the coverage of the rules is usually more than 100%, rules are not mutually exclusive. When we look for redundant rules we look for rules "completely contained in" other rules, but for example if we have:
Attribute_1 = yellow --> Class 1
Attribute_2 = big and Attribute_3 = adult --> Class 1
These two rules are not completely contained in each other, nevertheless an instance can verify both rules:
Attribute_1 = yellow, Attribute_2 = big, Attribute_3 = adult, Class = 1
