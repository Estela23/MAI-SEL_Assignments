Suposing we do not have missing values nor outliers, we only need to discretize the values of the attributes that are non categorical. We will do this task dividing the values of each numerical column into 4 bins, corresponding to the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). For discretizing we used np.linspace

Note that there are some data of the same type and in some cases we may want to discretize and in others don't. For example: in cmc.data "age" and "weducation" are integer attributes, in this case "age" is a numerical attribute that wa may want to discretize but "weducation" is a categorical attribute which takes values from 1=low to 4=high, in this case we want to mantain the actual format of values 1, 2, 3 and 4. For this reason we examined the attributes of each dataset we wanted to classify and introduce 'by-hand' the numerical (integer) attributes that we want to discretize.
